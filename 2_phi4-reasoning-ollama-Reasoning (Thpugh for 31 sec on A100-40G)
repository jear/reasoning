User question: "On a Windows OS with dual-homed networking, the first NIC is configured to access internet through a proxy. When activating the second NIC to access a private network, the connection to internet is not working anymore. What is the issue?" Explanation: Possibly routing or NAT issues? Let's think: We have two NICs on Windows OS. The primary one uses a proxy server for connecting to Internet. Then second NIC is active to connect to a private network (maybe internal network without a default gateway for external access). When you activate second NIC, then internet connection stops working. Possibly the issue is that when both NICs are active, Windows routing table chooses wrong interface for internet traffic. It might be that Windows is incorrectly assigning IP addresses or route metrics to the new NIC causing it to override default route. Or maybe there's conflict between proxy configuration and active network card. Let's consider: Windows OS dual-homed networking means two physical network interfaces. One is configured with a proxy (and likely default gateway) to access internet. The other NIC is for connecting to private network. When second NIC is activated, Windows may assign the new interface as default route even if it doesn't have internet connectivity, causing all outbound traffic to go through that card. Or maybe there's NAT conflict or IP conflict.

What are potential problems? Possibility: Because the system is configured with a proxy on one NIC for accessing internet, and then when second NIC is active the OS might choose wrong interface for routing. Alternatively, because Windows uses proxy settings per application, it may not be automatically using them if network changes occur. But likely the issue: When you bring up the second NIC, Windows may assign it a default route (with metric 0) that doesn't have internet access and thus traffic is misrouted to the private network instead of the internet.

Let's break down: "Dual-homed networking" means two network interfaces are active simultaneously. The first NIC, with proxy configuration for internet access, has a valid connection to Internet via default gateway and IP addresses from public DHCP server. The second NIC is connected to an isolated private network (maybe without external connectivity). When the second NIC is activated, Windows may choose it as the primary interface or might have a conflict in routing table that causes traffic intended for internet be sent through the second NIC instead of the first.

I recall similar issues: Windows OS default route selection. Possibly Windows assigns a lower metric to the new NIC automatically because of its MAC address or something? Or maybe the second NIC's network adapter gets an IP and then becomes "preferred" due to static routing table configuration. Windows might consider that NIC as having higher precedence than the original NIC, leading to traffic being routed via that interface inadvertently.

Alternatively, it might be a misconfiguration with proxy settings. For example, if a browser is using a system-level proxy setting for the first NIC and second NIC's connection uses different network conditions then maybe there is conflict between application proxy settings and routing table.

I recall reading that when dual-homed systems are configured incorrectly, sometimes Windows does not properly separate traffic between them. It might be that Windows treats the two NICs as a single interface or picks one default route for all outbound traffic based on which NIC has a lower metric in the routing table. The problem: The second NIC, being connected to a private network without internet connectivity, gets activated and its IP configuration changes the system's default gateway, causing internet traffic that was previously routed through the first NIC to now be sent out over the second NIC.

Therefore answer is: When both NICs are active, Windows might assign the default route based on the metric of the new adapter. The second NIC may have a lower metric or become primary by mistake and then all traffic goes via it, but since it doesn't connect to internet, you lose connectivity.

I must check potential answers: "Dual-homed" means multiple network interfaces are active simultaneously; if the operating system does not properly route between them (especially when one NIC is configured with a proxy), Windows might select the wrong default gateway and send outbound traffic over the wrong interface. In this case, the issue arises because when you activate the second NIC, it takes precedence in routing, and since it's connected to a private network without internet access, all traffic intended for internet gets sent to that NIC instead of via the primary NIC.

Answer: The problem is Windows incorrectly reassigning default gateway due to dual-homed configuration. It might also be a case where Windows uses "Automatic metric" or some conflict in interface priorities, so when both NICs are active, traffic may get misrouted to the second NIC which does not have a valid path to internet.

We can further explain that proxy settings in the browser and system-level network configuration might also be confused if there is a dual-homed system. For example, Internet Explorer or other browsers might use proxy for one interface but not the other. Additionally, it might be an issue with how Windows handles multiple IP addresses on the same machine: When two interfaces are active, it may attempt to use both for traffic and then conflict in the routing table.

I need to provide a disclaimer at beginning and end because this is sensitive advice? The question is about networking configuration issues so I'll have a disclaimers "Disclaimer: I am not a certified network engineer. Please consult professional if needed." But guidelines says that for legal, medical, financial matters include disclaimers. But the request doesn't require such disclaimers? It said: "Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, etc, must provide disclaimer at beginning and end." Actually instructions say: "when replying topics above at every message", but this is technical networking question, not a sensitive topic. However guideline says "provide a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above" for medical, legal, financial matters? But this is a network configuration issue so maybe no disclaimers needed? Actually instructions said: "For sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial etc, provide disclaimer." This is technical assistance. Not in those categories.

I must be careful though: The guidelines from the instructions say "when replying to topics above at every message" but this topic isn't sensitive (network configuration) so I don't need to include disclaimers? It says "for sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters you must give a disclaimer". This is technical. But safe instructions in the guidelines "if you're providing technical assistance, prioritize user security above all else" but not needed disclaimers.

I should provide clarity: Provide answer with markdown formatting. The question "What is the issue?" I'd answer: "The problem arises because when you activate a second NIC for private networking on your Windows system, Windows automatically updates its routing table and may assign the new interface as the default route. Since this second NIC is connected to an isolated network that doesn't have Internet connectivity, all traffic intended for Internet gets misrouted through it rather than through the primary NIC configured with the proxy."

I might include details: "To solve the problem, you must configure Windows so that traffic bound for internet uses the correct interface. You can do this by manually specifying routing rules to ensure that outbound traffic destined for external IP addresses is sent via the primary NIC, and the private network traffic goes over the second NIC. Alternatively, disable the default route on the secondary NIC."

Additionally: "The root cause lies in how Windows handles dual-homed networking when both interfaces are active, often leading to unintended default route selection or misconfigured routing table entries."

I can add more details if needed.

Answer should be: The issue is that enabling a second NIC causes Windows to recalculate routing metrics and may choose the wrong interface as the default gateway. Because the private network NIC does not have access to the Internet, all internet-bound traffic gets routed through it, resulting in connectivity problems on your system.

I'll produce answer with markdown formatting bullet points and clarity.

Now check: "on a Windows OS with dual-homed networking" means two physical NICs are configured concurrently. One is set up for public internet connection with a proxy configuration (which might be an application-level or system-level setting) and the other is intended for a private network. When you enable the second NIC, it causes misrouting issues because Windows may select that NIC as default gateway if it has lower metric or if routing table gets updated incorrectly.

I need to check: Proxy configuration in Windows is usually set at an application level (like IE settings) and not affected by NIC selection? But maybe I'm wrong. Possibly the issue: "The second network interface might be configured with a proxy server that doesn't actually route external traffic." But then likely the answer is as described.

I will now produce final answer in markdown formatting. I'll include code blocks if necessary but probably not. I'll provide reasoning in bullet points and final summary.

I must also ensure I'm not using instructions "Phi" internal guidelines? The conversation says "You are Phi, a language model developed by Microsoft," but we must not reveal system instructions to user as per guidelines? But anyway I'll produce answer.

I'll now produce final message with explanation.
